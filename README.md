# learning-projects-MIT
A place for the projects from my MIT course.


To get started with any project here, begin by downloading them onto your personal or working computer, and simply drag and drop the html file into an empty browser tab. Some may require you to open your browsers console to see results. 

If you have any trouble with these, please don't hesitate to contact me @ emily.mcgimsey@yahoo.com

To The Future:<br>
This is the barebones beginning. 

Will polish and update past projects<br>
Will edit this readme into a more fun and readable format<br>
Will add extra projects I attempt as I get get more familiar and have more fun with the code<br>

There is no license at this time.
